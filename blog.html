                    <h2>Almora – The Lakes, Hills and the forest</h2>
                    <p>A gateway to the best of Uttarakhand, Almora offers so much more than meets the eye. A step out of Almora gives you stunning snow views, dense jungles, idyllic villages, rare temples and clear rivers. Almora is a surprise package, and this is not just about its ‘bal mithai’ fudge with roasted khoya and sugar balls. A mere 10-kilometre uphill drive from the main road to Almora town leads you to the heart of one of Uttarakhand’s best-kept secrets, the Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary. Birds, tall trees and solitude are the best by-products of Binsar. Quaint villages at the fringes and inside the sanctuary have their own stories to tell. The Sun Temple of Katarmal is one of the only two sun temples in all of India. All this and more, Almora waits to be untraveled.</p>

                    <p>A 2km walk from the parking area, the temple compound, enchantingly shrouded in the early morning mist, looms with intricately designed walls and panels. An ancient idol of Vraddhaditya, a sun God and the custodian image of this temple, is illuminated by the very first rays of the sun as it breaks the horizon. With a lush forest backdrop, feel the warmth of devotion (or maybe it’s the sun) wash over you while you enjoy these mystical ruins.</p>
                    <h2>Walk to the Kosi Rive</h2>
                    <img src="./images/Kosi-River-1.jpg" alt="Almora Kosi River" class="img">
                    <p>Just short of the Sun Temple, this walk is an unforgettable journey through a verdant forest smeared with idyllic villages and a healthy ecosystem brimming with an array of wildlife and birds. Jump across the smooth rocks that have been ladled quite generously along the banks of the trickling waters of Kosi keeping an eye out for the pleasant culture shock you may be dealt here.</p>
